# Course Exercise Codes

Welcome to the repository for the exercises provided during our course. This repository is a collection of code examples, exercises, and solutions that were discussed and worked on throughout the duration of the course.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to offer a collection of code samples and exercises that were part of our learning journey. These codes are intended to serve as a reference and a learning tool for all.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific topic or module covered in the course. Within each folder, you will find the relevant exercises and their solutions. The structure is organized as follows:
